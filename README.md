# Tyger

## Introduction

Tyger is a program that generates code (in C or Python) to manipulate
data structures. These data structures are defined using a simple
language. The generated code can be used to read or write them to
(binary) files, send and receive them across a network, or pack and
unpack them into byte buffers.

See [Tyger documentation](https://www.jaccovanschaik.net/Tyger/) for more details.
